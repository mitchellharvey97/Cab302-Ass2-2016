Summary Agreement Statement:
  We (Andrew & Mitchell) hereby declare that the summary (as written above) is true, correct and fully discloses the contrubutions to the assessment.

Attempt:
  The charting version of the GUI has been attempted.
  The GUI showcases a start page, simulation log, line graph, and bar chart.

Known Bugs:
  - Associate Professor James M Hogan keeps appearing on the start screen.
  
Final Statements:
  - In future revisions of the application, we would choose to refactor the asgn2Simulators package such that SimulationRunner be the controller for all data and the GUI. In our current implementation, code is duplicated from it's runSimulation() method for a custom implementation. In a future revision of the software, static classes should be implemented for GUISimulator to interface with.
